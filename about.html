         <h1 class="page-title">About Seth Perkins</h1>
         <br>
         <h2 class="section-title">The Advocate</h2>
         <p>Seth has spent his entire adult life working in advocacy. Whether for our
brothers and sisters living on the street, or for our children, or our environment, or now
in the field of mental health. Seth currently runs a respite home for folks transitioning out
of psychiatric facilities and prisons. In a way, Seth has always had a job provided by the
material and psychological effects of capitalism. He has seen first hand the trauma
inflicted upon the most vulnerable of society, and it has led him to his decision to seek
public office. He will be beholden to the working people of our district and state, not to
the millionaires and billionaires. The same cannot be said about others on Beacon Hill. </p>
         <h2 class="section-title">The Union Leader</h2>
         <p>Seth is a proud member of, and steward for, the Service Employees
International Union. SEIU represents laborers in essential services such as hospital
workers, home care and nursing home workers, public service (including education)
workers; and property services workers. Members of the SEIU have been on the front
lines of this pandemic and understand the material necessities required to successfully
combat it. These workers have staved us off from utter chaos through solidarity, not
bosse’ orders. Turns out the most efficient way to handle a crisis is teamwork. In
Massachusetts, we are faced with several crises: the opioid crisis, the mental health
crisis, the housing crisis, the environmental crisis, and the educational crisis, to name a
few. The solution to all of these is, yet again, teamwork. The only way to tackle the
problems facing our Commonwealth is the strategy of Union: greater communal
participation and popular control of resources. Seth wants to apply the Union model
across our Commonwealth because neither privatization nor centralized authority has
resolved our serious problems.

         <h2 class="section-title">The Minuteman</h2>
         <p>Seth was born and raised in Massachusetts, and apart from a service
year with Americorps, has lived here his entire life. Originally from Gloucester, Seth 
spent time in Western Mass attending the University of Massachusetts, where he
studied political science and history. Wherever he has gone, Seth has held the proud
title of “neighbor” and has deeply invested his time in the interests of those around him.
He has always been committed to the notion of the Commonwealth, or the revolutionary
idea that we are obligated to care for one another simply because we share the same
street. Or the same neighborhood. Or the same city. Or the same state. We are
necessarily interconnected, and neighborliness is an act of revolution.</p>
        <br>
         <p>Seth excitedly enrolled as a Democrat at age 18 and stayed loyal until the defeat of
Donald Trump. Seth thinks fondly of Democrats despite his exiting the party. Growing
up, Seth had a modest background that became much more modest after the death of
his father during the 2008 financial crisis. His mother, a house cleaner, and his brother
scraped by the best they could. Thanks to many good Democratic families, and some
apolitical folk, Seth was taken care of. He became a Democrat because he saw their
benevolence firsthand and believed in the system. However, as of recent it appears that
the system itself is incorrect. Democrats are good capitalists, but Seth is no longer a
capitalist. Regardless of political affiliation, local politics is about fighting for those you
love, for your home, and for your neighbor. That’s Seth’s goal: to be a minuteman on
behalf of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.</p>
