         <h2 class="section-title">Redistribution of Wealth</h2>
         <p>Currently there are 15,000 millionaires (including some
billionaires) living in the state of Massachusetts. Meanwhile, nearly a million live under
the poverty line and millions more are still struggling to get by.</p>
<p><em>"The Commonwealth"</em> program would levy an additional state tax of 20% on all individual revenue past the second million. This would allow:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Millions in grant money and the empowerment of every municipality to decide how it would best serve their people</li>
   <li>Grant money to create housing cooperatives and encourage service industry cooperatives</li>
   <li>Rent and housing relief</li>
   <li>A $1,000 stimulus to the majority of residents in the state</li>
</ul>
<p>There are roughly 18,000 living on the streets in Massachusetts, yet 64,000 vacation
homes in Barnstable County alone. In fact, 20% of homes in Massachusetts are 
considered vacation homes and lay dormant for the majority of the year.</p>
<p>The <em>Non-Occupancy Fee</em>, or <em>Playground Tax</em>, would charge non-residents 2% of home
value every month they are absent. Homeowners who were originally residents of the
state and have moved elsewhere will not be subject to this tax. The generated revenue
will be split between going directly to the hosting municipality (to use as they see fit) and
to statewide housing relief. Vacationers may opt out of this fee by volunteering their
vacant homes to be used as emergency shelter or community development.</p>
         <h2 class="section-title">Rent Control</h2>
         <p>All rent will be capped at its current place. If landlords are unable to keep
up with expenses they may opt into the Commonwealth program and convert their units
into a cooperative space. Therefore, tenants would no longer be renters but
<em>shareholders</em> of the unit, and may sell off their share when they please.</p>
         <!-- <div class="pullquote">
            <span>You can have tags like this on every page, or not - you can even have multiple per page if you want.</span>
         </div> -->
         <h2 class="section-title">"The Kraft Rule"</h2>
         <p>Any money gained through labor that was never, ever, directly
participated in by “earners” should be considered suspect. If a billion is made from the
ownership of laborers it is subject to an 80% tax. All revenue generated will be used to
pay down state deficits.</p>
<p>What this means for Allston/Brighton:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Financial assistance for renters and homeowners</li>
   <li>Building housing cooperatives, giving poor and young people a sense of ownership in
their lives and abolishing the assumption of debt as a rite of passage</li>
<li>Grant money for schools, community centers and small businesses</li>
<li>$1,000 for each individual</li>
<li>The guarantee of housing</li>
<li>Serenity</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="section-title">The "Common Interest" Act</h2>
<p><em>The "Common Interest" Act</em> would ensure the legal right of workers in any noncooperative (non-employee-owned) workplace within our Commonwealth to unionize.
Any — whether the business is local or a chain. No employer would be allowed to
discourage collective bargaining or to put limitations on it in their contract. Once
workers have agreed to form a union, they will appoint a democratic representative
who will communicate on behalf of them to the state and other union operations. The
business specific union may group up with other unions as they see fit. If a business is
reported to have made attempts to prevent employees from unionizing, the situation will 
be investigated by the Department of Labor. If an outside company is aggressive to our
workers, our state, or threatens legal action, the facility and materials in it will be seized
by the state. Any attempt to move facilities out of the state to avoid these new laws will
be viewed as aggressive. </p>
<p>The “Common Interest” act would also give greater deference to communities on how
their natural resources are to be used or preserved. Of course, socialists take
environmental protection very seriously, but Seth trusts that communities are able to
govern themselves without big government. Under the “common interest” act, all
regulations concerning the collection of resources (fish, trees, farm foods, etc.) will be
suspended. The municipalities then will be allowed to regulate with nuance, allowing
individuals to take and leave as they need. However, the state will still investigate
environmental impact and, if it appears to be a threat to the environment, the
municipality forfeits control.</p>
<p>What this means for Allston/Brighton:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Job security</li>
   <li>Local control of parks</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h1 class="page-title">Rebuilding the Public Trust</h1>
<h2 class="section-title">Law Enforcement</h2>
<p>We believe it is redundant (and costly) to have both local and state
police. Seth will lead the charge to abolish the State Police and direct funding towards
infrustruce and stop all tolls.</p>
<h2 class="section-title">Transportation</h2>
<p>Tax the endowment of all universities in Massachusetts that charged full
price for screen-only learning and use the revenue to rebuild the T. Students from these
universities will be granted a yearlong pass.</p>
<h2 class="section-title">Political Reforms</h2>
<ol>
   <li>Term limits for all state offices. Service in these roles should be capped at eight
years.</li>
<li>Pay cut of $10,000 for all state elected officials This money instead will be pooled to
publicly, and cheaply, finance state elections.</li>
<li>An end to campaign fundraising for state office</li>
<li>Introducing ranked-choice voting in the legislature</li>
<li>Financial report of spending and revenue mailed out to every resident every year</li>
</ol>
<p>What this means for Allston/Brighton:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Only eight years of me!</li>
   <li>A fixed T</li>
   <li>Revenge on your university if you're an indebted student</li>
   <li>Better public infrastructure</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h1 class="page-title">Social Reforms</h1>
<h2 class="section-title">Sex Worker Liberation</h2>
<p>I will propose legislation to legalize prostitution in Massachusetts.</p>
<h2 class="section-title">Establish a Department of Marijuana, Alcohol, and Prostitution</h2>
<p>This department would
assume the responsibility of running all cannabis dispensaries, liquor stores and brothels. All
three would become state owned, with the previous owners of the liquor stores and dispensaries
well-compensated. The department would ensure that all operations are conducted
safely and allow the revenue to be consolidated in one place.<br><br> Workers in this field would
be state employees and entitled to a union. The state will support their union building
process unconditionally but not author it. After the transition to state ownership the
workers will be free to create their terms and network. Until their union is formed these
workers will be connected to other unions so they may have surrogate advocacy.
Revenue from these fields, in part, will be continued to be allocated to where they were
previously going. Remaining revenue will be used to lower costs of community college.
This legislation will not only legalize prostitution but decriminalize non-registered sex
work. Meaning no sex worker will face legal reprecussions for their decision not to
register, but it is highly encouraged for their own health and safety.</p>
<h2 class="section-title">Prisons</h2>
<p>Ultimately, the goal of socialists is prison abolition, but that’s not so cozy with
everyone and it’s difficult to do all at once. It is unfortunate that we have no place for ex-prisoners to go after leaving incarceration and so they often end up returning. Prison
structures will continue to house incarcerated souls, but as a timeout — not as a
punishment.<br><br> Prisoners will be visited by social workers and aided in organizing their
own interpretation of being removed from society. There will be no cell time and
prisoners will be free to do what they please within the walls. The state will slowly phase
out prison guards for advisors in health, cooking, literacy, and organizing. Prisoners will
learn to work with each other to improve their living conditions.<br><br> The outcome will be this:
a self-sufficient prison population that can secure better nourishment and personal joy
with funds that are no longer being used to oppress them. There will be an LSW in
place of a warden, and visiting community advisors. A few guards will remain solely to 
prevent harm towards the state officials. They will not patrol. Excessively violent
offenders will be transferred to psychiatric facilities. Prison labor will be eliminated. Folks
leaving jail will work with the state social worker/advisors to create an aftercare
program. If there is no job or home for the prisoner to land after release, they may
request a 30 day stay. After that, they will be put in respite or linked up to a shelter. Our
push for massive prison restructuring is based in our hope for eventual prison abolition.
We believe things are rigged and it forces people to make wrong choices. We believe
people should still have to confront these choices, just not in a publicly funded hell.</p>
<h2 class="section-title">LGBTQ Rights</h2>
<p>We queer folk are lucky to have a home state that is safer for us than
many others, with many legal protections. But there is more we can do to make it safe
and “comfy” for all folks. That’s why I would propose the “Safer Home” act which would:
<ul>
   <li>Streamline the ability to change one’s name and gender on official documents, giving
the RMV the authority to advocate on behalf of residents to change all titles along with
their license.</li>
<li>Massive overhaul of sex education for grades 6-12 based on an agreed-upon state
curriculum devised by professionals and advocates</li>
<li>Spectrum prison assignment, ensuring that an individual is comfortable with their cell
mate and has the option to be “housed” with another queer person</li>
<li>Mandatory gender education for public sectors</li>
<li>Tax credits for businesses creating single-stall gender neutral bathrooms</li></ul>

<h2 class="section-title">Adoption, Foster Care & Mentor Program</h2>
<p>There are many great foster parents and
orphanages out there, but there are also a lot of horrible ones. Every year many
children are physically, sexually, and emotionally abused at these facilities. However, we
are limited in our capacity for housing them if they cannot live on their own. So we
must bond them with a mandatory state reporter who will work with them until adulthood
or until they are in family care. Our state employees for the most part retire comfortably
and are left with some spare time on their hands, or are looking for a side gig. After
volunteering into this program they will be paired with a child who they will keep tabs on
once a week. The child will be briefed by them on things that are appropriate and not
appropriate in a foster care setting. This way the child has a trusted adult to voice
concerns to, and the adult has been verified by the state through a career of public
service.</p>
<h2 class="section-title">Death with Dignity</h2>
<p>Legislation to legalize assisted suicide for those dying and in
tremendous pain. We believe the state has no business telling us how long our final
hours will be, especially given its neglect towards us while we are truly living.</p>
<h2 class="section-title">Sanctuary State</h2>
<p>We approve of the Safe Communities Act. However, we believe a
stronger proposal is necessary to protect those in our commonwealth. We prefer and
will pursue legislation that will refuse entry by I.C.E. in our state.</p>
<p>What this means for Allston/Brighton:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Remember our district, majority renters, reflects much of the state as a whole and will
stand to benefit from all reforms.</li>
</ul>
<h1 class="page-title">Racial Justice Reforms</h1>
<h2 class="section-title">Police</h2>
<p>As stated previously we desire to fully abolish the State Police. We can push
forward racial justice and end all state tolls. At the state level we of course cannot
control how municipalities conduct themselves in terms of police funding. We can
however keep a close eye on stations across the state. I will propose the “Direct
Justice” act, which will grant the state greater authority to intervene with regard to police
misconduct. If citizens of a municipality believe there was police misconduct that was
racially motivated, they may take the complaint directly to the Direct Justice Committee.
The Direct Justice Committee will be a group of black legal advocates granted
permission by the legislature to make a decision on the case. If they choose to accept it,
the police and those who filed the complaint will present before the committee. The
Committee will decide all actions to be taken and they will be legally binding.</p>

<h2 class="section-title">Black Joy</h2>
<p>I will propose legislation to create a council on Black Joy. The council will be
composed of volunteer scholars, artists, and advocates to celebrate Blackness however
they see fit. They will be allowed to organize the Black community through state funding
however they see fit.</p>
<h1 class="page-title">Environment</h1>
<h2 class="section-title">Environmental Justice</h2>
<p>By granting communities the authority to use their resources as
they see fit through the “Common Interest” act, this also means localities have a greater
defense against polluters. If there are polluters or private industries encroaching on the
public health of residents, they will be allowed by law to shut it down or otherwise seize
control of it. The State cannot permit private industry to do anything without the consent
of those who can be directly affected. If a City allows pollution in a manner that harms
residents of a certain part of town, they are entitled to a hearing with the Direct Justice
committee. In terms of immediate action, I will be there chaining myself to the building
with all who want the pollution to end.</p>
<p>Massachusetts may be a progressive state, but its environmental habits
are very poor. I will work to embody the ideas of the Green New Deal in state legislation.
I will propose the “Common Green” legislation that grants every person the legal right to
a “share” of the environment. This means that if there is fracking or any abuse of the
environment, the money generated from it must be equally distributed to everyone in
Massachusetts.</p>
<p>Additionally, some immediate actions:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Immediately ending state universities’ use of fossil fuels</li>
   <li>Banning fracking</li>
   <li>Funding poop-to-clean-energy projects</li>
   <li>Criminal charges brought against oil companies on behalf of the State of
Massachusetts</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h1 class="page-title">Practice Makes Perfect</h1>
<h2 class="section-title">The Tenants Bill of Rights</h2>
<p>If I was interested in pushing forward with mild reforms that
would never get anywhere in a conservative Democratic state house, I would still have a
“D” in front of my name. I’m not. I want to meet our multiple crises head on with
proposal and practice. We have many proposals concerning housing and renters rights,
but we also have demands. During this campaign we will be having folks sign the
Tenants Bill of Rights to signal that we are in solidarity and can flip the table over at any
moment.</p>
<p>Here are the demands:</p>
<ol>
   <li>The right to accessible housing, with no cost incurred by the renter for essential
repairs.</li>
<li>End no-fault evictions. A tenant should not lose housing for not being able to pay an
increased rent.</li>
<li>Legal council, no trial between landlord and tenant unless both parties have council.</li>
<li>No eviction histories.</li>
<li>No extra fees on top of first, last, and deposit.</li>
<li>Right to reasonable renewal: a tenant should not have to commit to renewal more
than two months before the lease ends.</li>
<li>Right to knowing your landlord: information concerning your landlord’s properties and
legal battles should be public record.</li>
<li>All tenant rights publicly and easily accessible.</li>
<li>The Right to Organize.</li>
</ol>
<p>Fortunately, the last right is actually granted to us. We have the ability to make a
renter’s union. In a district like Allston/Brighton where 80% of residents are renters, we
sure do have a hell of a Union to make. Join us.</p>
